## Supported Languages

The following languages are available by default:

| name         |                     description |

| `english1k`  |  1000 most common English words |
| `english10k` | 10000 most common English words |

## Logging

Upon completion of a test, a row outlining your results is appended to the
`log.csv` file found in the following platform-specific folders. This way you
can easily track your progress over time.

| platform | value                                                            |                                        example |
| :------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------: |
| Linux    | $XDG*CONFIG_HOME/\_project_path* or $HOME/.config/_project_path_ |                      /home/colby/.config/thokr |
| macOS    | $HOME/Library/Application Support/_project_path_                 | /Users/Colby/Library/Application Support/thokr |

## Roadmap

- [ ] ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance
  - Right now there are known performance issues surrounding the rendering of
    the tui at each tick interval and/or key press. Ideally each render uses the
    prior render as a base and only makes the necessary adjustments (possibly
    using
    [StatefulWidget](https://docs.rs/tui/0.10.0/tui/widgets/trait.StatefulWidget.html)),
    but I haven't been able to figure that out yet.
- [ ] üî† Multi-language support
  - I decided not to launch thokr with languages besides english because of some
    odd rendering issues I was experiencing when trying to input characters with
    accents. It's as though I'm not able to properly input the character in [raw
    mode](https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.3.0/crossterm/raw/index.html). I'd love to
    have that figure out before shipping other languages because I personally
    felt the experience was a bit jarring. I'll open an bug report for it with
    more details and replication steps -- would love more eyes on that problem!
- [ ] üß™ Tests
  - I've only written a small amount of tests at this point. I haven't sat down
    to really think through what tests look like when the output is dependent on
    the users terminal size, font size, etc. If you have any ideas for this please
    open up an issue and start the discussion!
